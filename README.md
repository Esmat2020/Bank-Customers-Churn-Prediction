# Churn-Prediction-Bank-Customers
# Introduction
We are given the dataset about bank information of around 10000 customers and also given if they have churned or not. Our task is to build a ML model such that we can predict if a customer is going to churn or not. We will also perform EDA on this dataset to inform the bank on what they could do to minimise the churn and build a sustainable business. We are going to use LazyClassifier which has around 29 pre-trained models which will help us find out the best model on basis of accuracy and time taken.
